# What is InfluxDB?

InfluxDB is a time series, metrics, and analytics database. It’s written in Go and has no external dependencies. That means once you install it there’s nothing else to manage (like Redis, ZooKeeper, HBase, or whatever).

InfluxDB is targeted at use cases for DevOps, metrics, sensor data, and real-time analytics.
