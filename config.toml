### Welcome to the InfluxDB configuration file.

# Once every 24 hours InfluxDB will report anonymous data to m.influxdb.com
# The data includes raft id (random 8 bytes), os, arch, version, and metadata.
# We don't track ip addresses of servers reporting. This is only used
# to track the number of instances running and the versions, which
# is very helpful for us.
# Change this option to true to disable reporting.
reporting-disabled = false

###
### [meta]
###
### Controls the parameters for the Raft consensus group that stores metadata
### about the InfluxDB cluster.
###

  # If enabled, when a Raft cluster loses a peer due to a `DROP SERVER` command,
  # the leader will automatically ask a non-raft peer node to promote to a raft
  # peer. This only happens if there is a non-raft peer node available to promote.
  # This setting only affects the local node, so to ensure if operates correctly, be sure to set
  # it in the config of every node.
  raft-promotion-enabled = true

###
### [data]
###
### Controls where the actual shard data for InfluxDB lives.
###

[data]
  dir = "/data/db"

  # Controls the storage engine used for new shards. Engines available are b1,
  # bz1, and tsm1. b1 was the original default engine from 0.9.0 to 0.9.2. bz1
  # has been the default engine since 0.9.3. tsm1 was introduced in 0.9.5 and is
  # currently EXPERIMENTAL. Consequently, data written into the tsm1 engine may
  # need to be wiped between upgrades.
  # engine ="bz1"
  
  # The following WAL settings are for the b1 storage engine used in 0.9.2. They won't
  # apply to any new shards created after upgrading to a version > 0.9.3.
  max-wal-size = 104857600 # Maximum size the WAL can reach before a flush. Defaults to 100MB.
  wal-flush-interval = "10m" # Maximum time data can sit in WAL before a flush.

  # These are the WAL settings for the storage engine >= 0.9.3
  wal-dir = "/data/wal"

###
### [hinted-handoff]
###
### Controls the hinted handoff feature, which allows nodes to temporarily
### store queued data when one node of a cluster is down for a short period
### of time.
###

[hinted-handoff]
  enabled = true
  dir = "/var/lib/influxdb/hh"
  max-size = 1073741824
  max-age = "168h"
  retry-rate-limit = 0

  # Hinted handoff will start retrying writes to down nodes at a rate of once per second.
  # If any error occurs, it will backoff in an exponential manner, until the interval
  # reaches retry-max-interval. Once writes to all nodes are successfully completed the
  # interval will reset to retry-interval.
  retry-interval = "1s"
  retry-max-interval = "1m"

  # Interval between running checks for data that should be purged. Data is purged from
  # hinted-handoff queues for two reasons. 1) The data is older than the max age, or
  # 2) the target node has been dropped from the cluster. Data is never dropped until
  # it has reached max-age however, for a dropped node or not.
  purge-interval = "1h"

###
### [cluster]
###
### Controls non-Raft cluster behavior, which generally includes how data is
### shared across shards.
###

[cluster]

  write-timeout = "10s" # The time within which a write request must complete on the cluster.

###
### [retention]
###
### Controls the enforcement of retention policies for evicting old data.
###

[retention]
  enabled = true
  check-interval = "30m"

###
### [shard-precreation]
###
### Controls the precreation of shards, so they are available before data arrives.
### Only shards that, after creation, will have both a start- and end-time in the
### future, will ever be created. Shards are never precreated that would be wholly
### or partially in the past.

[shard-precreation]
  enabled = true
  check-interval = "10m"
  advance-period = "30m"

###
### Controls the system self-monitoring, statistics and diagnostics.
###
### The internal database for monitoring data is created automatically if
### if it does not already exist. The target retention within this database
### is called 'monitor' and is also created with a retention period of 7 days
### and a replication factor of 1, if it does not exist. In all cases the
### this retention policy is configured as the default for the database.

[monitor]
  store-enabled = true # Whether to record statistics internally.
  store-database = "_internal" # The destination database for recorded statistics
  store-interval = "10s" # The interval at which to record statistics

###
### [admin]
###
### Controls the availability of the built-in, web-based admin interface. If HTTPS is
### enabled for the admin interface, HTTPS must also be enabled on the [http] service.
###

  https-enabled = false

### mechanism for getting data into and out of InfluxDB.

### [collectd]
###
### Controls the listener for collectd data.
###

### [opentsdb]
###
### Controls the listener for OpenTSDB data.

###
### Controls the listener for InfluxDB line protocol data via UDP.
